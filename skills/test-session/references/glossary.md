# Glossary

Pack-specific terms. Standard testing terms (heuristic, oracle, tour, attack, SBTM, PO, smoke, regression) keep their RST and context-driven meaning.

- Driver: whatever operates the product for one probe (a browser subagent, an automation script).
- Probe: one focused thing you try on the product.
- User action: anything a person or agent who matters can do with the product, or can reasonably believe they can do from what it shows them (pressing something styled as a button, typing in a field, using Back).
- Target setting: a condition that changes what users experience and that the charter commits to covering (screen size, browser, signed in or out, language, no JavaScript).
- Evidence folder: from setup. The session folder is one session's dated folder inside it.
- BUG-NN: a numbered bug entry. Numbering is per project and continues across sessions (a fix charter keeps the old numbers); the next is one more than the highest in the project's bug list (its latest report's bug index, unless house rules or setup say otherwise). Can't find the list? Use a provisional number (`skills/BUG-new-1`) and ask. Bugs in your test tools belong to the project that owns them; in mixed lists, prefix the project (`shop/BUG-03`).
